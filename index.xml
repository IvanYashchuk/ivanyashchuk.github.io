      <description>Me and my mentor Vincent have a face-to-face meeting every Wednesday over videochat. Last week our weekly meeting was in person. I&amp;rsquo;ve visited Preferred Networks office (that&amp;rsquo;s the company behind Chainer) and met a few developers there and we had lunch together. They even have a little space with Tatami (japanese mat) in the common area! Unfortunately, I forgot to take pictures.
For the past days I was mostly focused on polishing existing PRs according to the code review.</description>

      <title>GSoC ChainerX: CPU bindings</title>

      <description>Linear algebra routines from this issue are now working both on CPU and GPU. When it comes to the choice of linear algebra library on CPU, the variety is much broader than on GPU. However, we don&amp;rsquo;t need a full featured linear algebra matrix library like Eigen, or Armadillo, as ChainerX has its own ndarray. Therefore, it was decided to use one of the LAPACK implementations. For now it seems that working with LAPACK (which is written in Fortran) directly without C wrappers is the way to go.</description>

      <description>Already two weeks of coding have gone past!
My progress can be tracked in this issue. Part of the project is making LAPACK routines accesible from ChainerX performing computations in CPU and GPU. Another part is making them differentiable.
LAPACK (Linear Algebra Package) is a standard software library for numerical linear algebra. It provides routines for solving systems of linear equations and linear least squares, eigenvalue problems, and singular value decomposition.</description>

      <description>Coding period start soon!
This summer I am going to work on extending ChainerX with some Linear Algebra routines. The goal is to implement common routines that are described at numpy.linalg. And their sensitivities for reverse mode automatic differentiation has to implemented as well!</description>
